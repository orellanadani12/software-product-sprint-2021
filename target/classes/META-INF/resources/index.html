                    My name is Fernando Orellana, I'm a sophomore/junior in college majoring in Software Engineering.
                    There are a lot of things I like to do besides programming! I love playing soccer/futsal, 
                    play the guitar,travel (I love to visit new places!!), and I enjoy spending time with 
                    friends and family overall &#128525;. 
                </p>

                <p> 
                    I was born in Santa Cruz, Bolivia but I currently live in Naples, Florida. I have many goals in my life
                    that I want to accomplish. One of my main goal is to work as a Software Engineer at one of the FAANG
                    companies. These goals are not too far to achieve, but one goal I always write down is to get straight
                    A's in all of my college courses each semester &#128516;.

                    A class project where we re-created the Snake Game using C++.
                    The player controls the snake using the arrow keys or the “WASD” keys to move the snake 
                    up, down, left, and right. As the snake eats, it starts to grow. 
                    If the snake’s head touches its body, it will terminate the game or if it hits the one of 4 borders 
                    then the game will finish. 
                </p>

                    Participated in a Hackathon called Shellacks where my team and I created a web app 
                    using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SQL. The idea of the web app is to have the user check-off the COVID-19
                    daily symptoms questions that apply to them and then it would pinpoint the location of the user who 
                    might have the virus and if there was too many possible cases depending on the population density 
                    it will send a notification to the US Health Department.
                </p>

                    Created a JavaFX Application that would simulate a Production Management System. It would ask for user's
                    credentials before being able to add anything to the production database. If the user's credentials
                    matched the user's credentials from the Employee database then it would allow the user to interact with 
                    the system.
